a) The source of data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset 
   The person who produced the data: Stefano Leone
   The data is pulled from: players_15.csv

b) There are three tables that describe the teams, players and characteristics.

      The characteristics belong to a a certain player in the players table.

c) Along the way, I was trying to map a foreign key to a non-key attribute. I also came across the error where my data had duplicate entries for a primary key.

d) Non-trivial information requests:

   1. Find the players who belong to the team RealMadrid and are 27 pounds.
   2. List the players who are from Argentina with a height greater than the average height from all countries.
